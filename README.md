# Scrape Data - IEC World Plugs

In this notebook, we build a list of plug types by country based on the [International
Electrotechnical
Commission's website](http://www.iec.ch/worldplugs/list_bylocation.htm).

I thought this would be a fun data set to use along with Geospatial data so I made sure to incude ISO Country Codes for easy mapping later on. This repository however, will only be dedicated to building a useable list of plug types.

The [worldstandards.eu](http://www.worldstandards.eu/electricity/plugs-and-sockets/) has some good pictures of these plug and socket types.

View the [Notebook](https://github.com/benjiao/world-plugs/blob/master/Scrape%20Data%20-%20IEC%20-%20World%20Plugs.ipynb) to see how i did the scraping.
